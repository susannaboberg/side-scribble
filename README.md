# Welcome to SideScribble!

SideScribble allows you to create new notes from any tab, and view your notes as you read through websites. This way, you reduce clutter and stop having to switch between so many tabs and windows. Use it to take notes on and keep track of recipes, shopping trips, travel planning, school research projects, and more.

Best for shorter-term note-taking, when you don't want to open yet another external note-taking software while using Chrome.
